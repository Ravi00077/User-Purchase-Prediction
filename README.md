# User-Purchase-Prediction
This project implements the Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm for predicting user purchase classification. It utilizes the user-data.csv dataset, which contains information about users and their purchase behavior. The goal is to train an SVM classifier to predict whether a user will purchase a particular product or not.
# Conclusion
The SVM classifier successfully predicts user purchase classification based on the provided dataset. The project demonstrates the use of SVM algorithm for binary classification tasks and provides visualizations of the decision boundary and class separation.
